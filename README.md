# Load-the-Diabetes-dataset-via-scikit-learn-for-prediction-purposes
In this analysis, I am building and evaluating a linear regression model on the Diabetes dataset, which is loaded from the scikit-learn package. The goal is to predict the target variable (Y) based on a set of input variables (X).

The first few lines of code import the Diabetes dataset and load it into Python variables. Then, the features and description of the dataset are printed to the console.

Next, the X and Y data matrices are created from the loaded dataset. The dimensions of both matrices are printed to the console to verify that the data has been loaded correctly.

The code then imports the necessary libraries from scikit-learn to build and evaluate a linear regression model. A model object is created using the LinearRegression() function.

To train the model, the fit() method is called on the model object with the training data (X_train, Y_train) as inputs. Once the model is trained, the predict() method is used to generate predictions on the test data (X_test).

The performance of the model is then evaluated by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R^2) between the predicted and actual values of the test data. The coefficients and intercept of the linear regression model are also printed to the console.
